<p>	My mother always told me about the miracles of lemons. She literally has an obsession with this fruit and I have been questioning this ever since.
If any of our family members got sick, she would grab the first lemon that she finds in our refrigerator, prepare the knife, cut the lemon in half, 
and squeeze all the lemon juice in a glass. She would then insist to let us drink the lemon juice. I'd been having doubts as to what properties this
fruit has to offer.
</p>

<p> 
One random afternoon, my mom and I sat at the dinner table talking about how our day was and as to what assignments we had. This topic kept going on 
for 3 minutes until it reached to the point of lemons for some odd reason. My mom then told her experience at the bathroom the other night.Right after 
she drank lemon juice, she began to feel like "nature" was calling her. She then headed to the bathroom and locked the door. She then described what 
happened in detail. When the solid turd was coming out, liquid was also leaking from the turd's sides! It was gross but at the same time fascinating.

<p>
My mom then finished doing her business and was shocked about what happened. She did her research and said that the lemon actually "detoxified" the
bacteria in her stomach and that the liquid that was leaking out was actually detoxified waste. It was amazing to hear that lemons could actually have that
type of effect on a human.
